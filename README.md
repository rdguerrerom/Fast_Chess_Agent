# Chess Agent README

## Overview

This Chess Agent is a comprehensive chess engine designed to play chess efficiently and effectively. It employs advanced algorithms and data structures to evaluate positions, generate moves, and make strategic decisions. The agent is implemented in Python and is suitable for integration into chess applications, AI research, or as a learning tool for understanding chess engine design.

## Key Features

- **Bitboard Representation**: Utilizes bitboards as the internal data structure for representing the chessboard, allowing for fast and efficient computation of moves and position evaluations.
- **Advanced Move Generation**: Implements efficient algorithms for generating legal moves, including special moves like castling, en passant, and promotions.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning with Iterative Deepening**: Employs the alpha-beta pruning algorithm with iterative deepening to optimize the search process and make deeper strategic decisions within time constraints.
- **Quiescence Search**: Integrates quiescence search to evaluate quiet positions more accurately and avoid the horizon effect in tactical evaluations.
- **Customizable Evaluation Function**: Features a modular evaluation function that can be extended or modified to include additional heuristics or machine learning models.
- **Dynamic Game Phase Assessment**: Determines the game phase (opening, middlegame, endgame) to adjust strategies and evaluation criteria accordingly.
- **Performance Assessment Tools**: Includes scripts for benchmarking and assessing the agent's performance across various metrics such as move quality, strategic effectiveness, and computational efficiency.

## Advantages of Using Bitboards

### Efficient Computation

Bitboards represent the chessboard as a set of 64-bit integers, where each bit corresponds to a square on the board. This representation allows for:

- **Fast Bitwise Operations**: Utilize low-level bitwise operations that are executed rapidly by modern CPUs, enabling quick calculations of moves and attacks.
- **Parallel Computations**: Perform operations on multiple pieces simultaneously, as bitwise operations can handle all pieces of the same type in a single computation.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Compactly store board states using minimal memory, which is crucial for deep search algorithms that require storing numerous positions.

### Simplified Move Generation

- **Attack Masks**: Easily generate attack patterns for pieces by shifting bits and applying masks, simplifying the implementation of move generation algorithms.
- **Efficient Board State Updates**: Update board states by manipulating bits, reducing the overhead associated with more complex data structures.
- **Streamlined Special Moves Handling**: Handle special moves like castling and en passant through specific bit manipulations, enhancing the clarity and efficiency of the code.

### Enhanced Performance in Search Algorithms

- **Faster Node Evaluation**: Rapidly evaluate nodes in the search tree due to efficient bitboard computations, allowing the agent to search deeper within the same time constraints.
- **Optimized Pruning Techniques**: Implement pruning strategies more effectively by quickly assessing positions and eliminating branches that won't yield better outcomes.
- **Scalability**: Bitboards scale well with increased computational resources, making them suitable for more advanced optimizations like parallel processing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Recommended: A modern CPU to take full advantage of bitwise operation optimizations

### Installation

Clone the repository and install any required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rdguerrerom/Fast_Chess_Agent.git
cd  Fast_Chess_Agent
```

### Usage

Run the agent's test script to see it in action:

```bash
python test_agent.py
```

Integrate the agent into your application by importing the `ChessAgent` class:

```python
from agent import ChessAgent

agent = ChessAgent()
# Initialize with custom parameters if needed
```
